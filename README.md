This is an encryption and Decryption React App. 

This app uses combines several cryptographic techniques, including AES encryption in CBC mode, PBKDF2 for key derivation, and proper usage of salts and initialization vectors (IVs), And this is a custom encryption implementation. It's a combination of well-established cryptographic primitives and practices tailored for a specific use case.

This app has been developed due to the need of Encryption and Decryption required while sending the Payload in the API that my company uses this is the by product of the main App which i cannot share due to confidential reasons.

The working of app is pretty simple paste the json select what you want to do and press run :)

How to Configure this project in your local system:
1.Do what you do for regular node project simple :).
